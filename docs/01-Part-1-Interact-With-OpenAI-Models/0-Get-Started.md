- Region 1️⃣ | Once authorized, shows the event profile.
- Region 2️⃣ | User prompt - used to enter text questions for AI
- Region 3️⃣ | Conversation - interleaved user questions & assistant responses
- Region 4️⃣ | Configuration - tunable parameters, execution stats
- Region 5️⃣ | System message - sets assistant persona, base context
- Region 6️⃣ | Function calling - save custom functions to set context
- Region 7️⃣ | Image generation - access the DALL-E model playground

## Tips

### 1. Select a Model

The playground supports multiple models. You must select a model from the **Model** dropdown in the **Configuration** section before you can interact with the model.

### 2. Clear Chat Sessions

The output of the model is influenced by the contents of the chat session. To ensure that the output of the model is not influenced by previous prompts, click the "Clear Chat" button **before entering each new prompt**.

### 3. Copy-Paste Snippets

In a prompt-based exercise, you will find the prompt input is provided to you in a _code-fenced_ snippet as shown below. When viewing this page in a browser, _click_ within the code-fenced region below to see a `copy` icon appear at the right. Click it to copy the prompt into your clipboard - then paste using <kbd>Ctrl-V</kbd> (or equivalent) command into the text input region in Playground.
