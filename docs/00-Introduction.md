## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Describe GPT model capabilities and implementation
- Understand prompt engineering concepts and best practices
- Apply prompt engineering techniques to build an Azure Open AI solution
- Implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to bring in external knowledge

## Lab Outline

The lab is organized into two parts. The first part focuses on understanding the basics of interacting with OpenAI models. You will be exploring the various prompt techniques and understanding how to guide the models to create better answers. The second part focuses on building a chatbot using the concepts learned in the first part. You will be using the Azure OpenAI Service and bringing in external knowledge using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to answer questions based on the knowledge base provided.
