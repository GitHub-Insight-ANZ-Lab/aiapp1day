User Review (4.8/5)
Excellent grip and durability – a must-have for mixed-terrain riders!"
I’ve been using the TerraGrip XTR for about three months now on my gravel/adventure bike, and I’m seriously impressed. Right out of the box, the tire had a great balance between stiffness and flexibility, making tubeless setup a breeze.
Performance-wise, it shines on gravel and singletrack. The side knobs give fantastic confidence in corners, and I barely feel any rolling resistance on pavement. I’ve taken it through mud, loose rock, and even some snow, and it holds its own in all conditions.
The ShieldGuard Protection is a real winner—so far, no punctures despite some pretty aggressive rides. My only minor gripe is that it wears slightly faster than expected on tarmac, but that's expected with such grippy tread.
Final Verdict: If you’re an adventure rider or a commuter who needs a versatile, tough tire, the TerraGrip XTR is worth every penny. Highly recommend!
