set is in development as \npart of post MICROS acquisition activities. References to former MICROS product names \nmay exist throughout this existing documentation set. \n \n \n\n1 \n \n \nAn Overview on LUCAS POS \n \nLUCAS POS is the universal retail management system for all sectors of the retail industry. \nWith LUCAS POS, we have assembled a suite of applications that will reliably manage and \ncontrol all business-critical processes in addition to providing valuable information about \ncustomers and employees. \nLUCAS POS is programmed in Pure Java and runs on Microsoft Windows as well as Linux. \nBased on the ARTS data model, LUCAS POS employs XML interfaces to ensure easy \nintegration with third party retail management, merchandising and stock solutions. \nThe following applications are part of the LUCAS POS Suite: \nThe Point of Service (POS) application offers a range of functions including till-oriented or \noperator-oriented operations, a convenient customer service system, the ability to process \nEFT payments and perform settlements during store opening hours, a sophisticated period \nconcept, and secure operation based on user rights. The way buttons are arranged and \nthe design of the configurable interface allow for quick and easy operation and reduce \ntraining to a minimum. The LUCAS POS application can be operated through a keyboard \n(MF2 or POS) and a two-line display instead of using a touchscreen. \nIn addition, the Customer Module for maintaining customer information may be integrated \nwith the till. This allows for new customer profiles to be created at the till as well and for \nexisting customer profiles to be viewed and edited. For each purchase a registered \ncustomer makes LUCAS POS links all items to the customer ID registered. Any discounts \nfor specific customers or groups of customers defined using Mix&Match are applied. If the \nsystem is used at the head office, any data will immediately be available throughout the \ncompany. \nOther benefits of centralized deployment include maintaining sales and voucher histories \nfor each customer. \nThe (Central) Store Management System (SMS/CSMS) allows for centralized \nadministration of all stores directly from the head office. It can be employed in stores \n(SMS) as well as at the head office (CSMS) and allows you to configure any workstation \nequipped with LUCAS POS. Moreover, it provides functions to execute daily or periodic \nclosings, a comprehensive report function, safe administration, and closing procedures. \nTransactions can be analysed employing a variety of criteria (e.g. receipt totals, operators, \ntills), which simplifies store management and allows for improved customer service. In \naddition, the SMS/CSMS provides a downgraded version of warehouse management \nfunctions required on-site (maintenance of items, tax rates, and promotions), suitable for \nsmaller maintenance tasks directly at the store. \nThe Transaction Pool (T-Pool) is an SQL database which runs in the head office. All \ncompany-related transactions (sales, closures, deposits, gift voucher redemptions, etc.) \nwill be exported as XML data and will be sent from the stores to be automatically imported \ninto the main database. Consequently all data generated in the stores will be contained in \nthe T-Pool. This data is vital the Gift Certificate Server. However, it is possible to use this \nSQL database to configure and customise other analyses, or to transfer sales data from \nthe T-Pool to the warehouse management system. \nThe Gift Certificate Verification Server (GCVS) is used in the head office and runs on a \ncentralized database (T-Pool). It is employed if selling and redeeming gift vouchers is \nenabled across the entire company. Using the server simplifies the process of handling \nvouchers and reduces any occurring processing costs. The risk of multiple voucher \nredemptions is eliminated and therefore fraud is reduced significantly. \n\n2 \n \n \nAbout this User Manual \n \nThis user manual outlines and explains the functions and operation of LUCAS POS. \nFor an overview on components and functions, read An Overview on LUCAS POS.  \nChapter 1 Launching will explain how to launch LUCAS POS. \nIn order to operate LUCAS POS, you must sign on. Chapter 2 Signing On will provide you \nwith any information necessary for sign-on. \nChapter 3 User Interface will explain the LUCAS POS user interface. It will provide you \nwith useful information on the touchscreen and on general control elements, such as input \nfields, list boxes and buttons. \nThe most important control functions within LUCAS POS executed in the Transaction and \nFinancing windows, will be explained in chapters 4 The Transaction Window, 5 Initiate Fi-\nnancing (The [ Total ] Button) and 6 Financing a Transaction (The Financing Window). \nChapters 7 The Position Closed Window and 8 Exiting the Till will explain how to call up \nthe Position Closed window and how to exit the till. \nChapter 9 Sales Functions will explain all sales functions available. Here you will learn how \nto return or discount items, how to reset a transaction, or carry out a settlement. \nChapter 10 Financing Functions will explain all financing functions available, e.g. financing \na receipt in cash or in foreign currency, or through vouchers and coupons. \nFrequently occurring keywords will be explained in chapter 11 Glossary. You can also refer \nto chapter 12 Index as well as the Contents to quickly access required information in this \nuser’s manual. \n \n \n \nThe range of functions available depends on the individual customising of your LUCAS \nPOS and the individual user rights. This could mean that some functions described in this \nuser manual may not be available when you sign on to LUCAS POS. \nThe graphical user interface in the screenshots contained in this user manual may differ \nfrom the user interface at your till. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Layout of this User Manual \n \nButtons, Notations und Cross References \n \nButtons and Notations \nTerms and labelling which appear on the POS’ interface are highlighted in bold. \nThe buttons visible on the screen are either displayed in graphic form or as follows: \n[ Button ] \nFunctions which are directly dependent on the previous execution of another function may \noccupy the same button as is the case in Suspend Sale and Resume Sale. The [ Resume \nSale ] button will only be active and visible once a Suspend Sale function has been \nexecuted. The [ Resume Sale ] button will occupy the same position as the [ Suspend \nSale ] button. \n \nCross References \nCross references to any chapter in this user manual are displayed in italics. Hold CTRL and \nclick on a cross reference to jump to the desired section within the user manual. \nFrom chapter 9 Sales Functions on you will find that all chapters introducing a new menu \nwithin LUCAS POS possess an additional cross reference tool for easy navigation between \nchapters. For an example of this tool, please refer to chapter 9.1 The Sale Menu. \n \nTerms used in the manual \nWhenever the term “select” is used (e.g. \"Select a position...\", \"Select a reason...\" etc.), \npress the designated position, reason etc. on the touchscreen. The position, reason etc. is \nselected and highlighted in colour. \n \nOptions and Instructions \n \nOptions \nOptions are displayed with a bullet in front. \n Option 1 \n Option 2 \n Option 3 \nWhenever an option is displayed you may choose whether or not you would like to follow \nthe instruction or set the preference described. There may be several options to choose \nfrom. Pick the one(s) which best suit your need at the point being. If none of the options \ndescribed are needed skip the option and proceed with the following step or paragraph. \n \nInstructions \nInstructions consist of at least one or more action steps. They need to be executed in the \norder described. \n1) Action step one. \nThis paragraph may be an explanation or description regarding the first action step. It may \nalso describe a change of state introduced by executing the action step. \n2) Action step two. \na) Action step a) which is dependend on action step 2. \nb) Action step b) which is dependent on the execution of action steps 2 and a). \nException: equated and non-dependent action steps are marked by the word “or”. \n3) Action step three. \n\n4 \n \n \n Optional action step following action step 3. \nIn some cases instructions may have additional options. The operator may decide which of \nthe options described is relevant to them or whether or not they would like to carry out or \nskip the option. \na) Options may have depending action steps as well. \n \nAdditional information \nAdditional information is displayed as follows. \n \n \n \nAn icon to the left of the box indicates the type of information displayed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis icon introduces useful information which you may decide to follow. \nThis icon introduces information critical to a function’s execution and therefore strongly \nrecommended to follow. \nBox with additional information \n\n5 \n \n \n1 Launching LUCAS POS \nClick once (using a Linux system) or twice (using a Windows system) onto the icon \nat the screen to launch LUCAS POS. \nThe system is launched and the Sign On window opens (see 2 Signing On). \n\n6 \n \n \n2 Signing On \nAfter launching LUCAS POS, the Sign On window opens. You need to sign on in order to \nwork the till. \n \n \nSign On window \n \nSign on with Operator Cards \n1) When using operator cards, simply scan the code. \nNo further entries required. \nSign on with Operator Number and Password \n1) If you do not have an operator card enter your operator number into the Operator field \nand your password into the Password field. \n2) Press [ OK ]. \nYou are signed onto the system and the Transaction window opens. LUCAS POS will be \nexecuted in the language set within your user profile and all functions you are authorised to \nperform are provided. Depending on the specific configuration of the system \n(\"Customising\"), the till drawer may open so that you can put your cash tray inside. \nIf you are not authorised to sign on or if the details you entered were incorrect, a \ncorresponding dialogue box will appear. Correct your entry or cancel the login procedure. \n \n \n \nOnce you have signed on, a receipt labeled “Sign On” is printed (if configured by default). \nIt contains information on the sign on process. \nAn information message may also be displayed after signing on to the till (e.g. to inform \nyou of a promotion). Confirm any information messages and sign the receipt printed. \n\n7 \n \n \n3 User Interface \nYour till is equipped with a touchscreen displaying the LUCAS POS user interface. The \ninterface can be customised and displays a variety of control elements, depending on the \nfunction selected. \nIn addition to providing instructions on how to use the touchscreen, this chapter describes \nthe structure of the user interface and explains the general control elements, such as input \nfields, output fields, and list boxes. \n \n \n3.1 Touchscreen \nYour till is equipped with a touchscreen to operate LUCAS POS. \n1) Touch a control element (e.g. buttons, entry fields, etc.) displayed on the screen using \nyour finger or a blunt object. \nThe control element is activated and the function requested is executed. \n \n \n3.1.1 Cleaning the Touchscreen Surface \nThe touchscreen surface needs to be cleaned on a regular basis. \n \n \n \n \n1) Press [ Cancel ] within the Sign On window. \nThe Position Closed window opens (see 7 The Position Closed Window). \n2) Press [ Clean Display ]. \n \n \nPosition Closed window showing the [ Clean Display ] button \n \nThe Clean Display window is displayed along with a set of cleaning instructions. \n3) Clean the screen following the instructions displayed. \nIf you need to clean the touchscreen while the till is still operating, call the cleaning mode. \nIn cleaning mode, most of the touchscreen’s control elements are hidden to prevent you \nfrom accidentally operating the till while you are cleaning the display.
