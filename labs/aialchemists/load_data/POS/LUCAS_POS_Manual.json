References to former MICROS product names may exist throughout this existing documentation set. 1 An Overview on LUCAS POS LUCAS POS is the universal retail management system for all sectors of the retail industry. With LUCAS POS, we have assembled a suite of applications that will reliably manage and control all business-critical processes in addition to providing valuable information about customers and employees. LUCAS POS is programmed in Pure Java and runs on Microsoft Windows as well as Linux. Based on the ARTS data model, LUCAS POS employs XML interfaces to ensure easy integration with third party retail management, merchandising and stock solutions. The following applications are part of the LUCAS POS Suite: The Point of Service (POS) application offers a range of functions including till-oriented or operator-oriented operations, a convenient customer service system, the ability to process EFT payments and perform settlements during store opening hours, a sophisticated period concept, and secure operation based on user rights. The way buttons are arranged and the design of the configurable interface allow for quick and easy operation and reduce training to a minimum. The LUCAS POS application can be operated through a keyboard (MF2 or POS) and a two-line display instead of using a touchscreen. In addition, the Customer Module for maintaining customer information may be integrated with the till. This allows for new customer profiles to be created at the till as well and for existing customer profiles to be viewed and edited. For each purchase a registered customer makes LUCAS POS links all items to the customer ID registered. Any discounts for specific customers or groups of customers defined using Mix&Match are applied. If the system is used at the head office, any data will immediately be available throughout the company. Other benefits of centralized deployment include maintaining sales and voucher histories for each customer. The (Central) Store Management System (SMS/CSMS) allows for centralized administration of all stores directly from the head office. It can be employed in stores (SMS) as well as at the head office (CSMS) and allows you to configure any workstation equipped with LUCAS POS. Moreover, it provides functions to execute daily or periodic closings, a comprehensive report function, safe administration, and closing procedures. Transactions can be analysed employing a variety of criteria (e.g. receipt totals, operators, tills), which simplifies store management and allows for improved customer service. In addition, the SMS/CSMS provides a downgraded version of warehouse management functions required on-site (maintenance of items, tax rates, and promotions), suitable for smaller maintenance tasks directly at the store. The Transaction Pool (T-Pool) is an SQL database which runs in the head office. All company-related transactions (sales, closures, deposits, gift voucher redemptions, etc.) will be exported as XML data and will be sent from the stores to be automatically imported into the main database. Consequently all data generated in the stores will be contained in the T-Pool. This data is vital the Gift Certificate Server. However, it is possible to use this SQL database to configure and customise other analyses, or to transfer sales data from the T-Pool to the warehouse management system. The Gift Certificate Verification Server (GCVS) is used in the head office and runs on a centralized database (T-Pool). It is employed if selling and redeeming gift vouchers is enabled across the entire company. Using the server simplifies the process of handling vouchers and reduces any occurring processing costs. The risk of multiple voucher redemptions is eliminated and therefore fraud is reduced significantly. 2 About this User Manual This user manual outlines and explains the functions and operation of LUCAS POS. For an overview on components and functions, read An Overview on LUCAS POS. Chapter 1 Launching will explain how to launch LUCAS POS. In order to operate LUCAS POS, you must sign on. Chapter 2 Signing On will provide you with any information necessary for sign-on. Chapter 3 User Interface will explain the LUCAS POS user interface. It will provide you with useful information on the touchscreen and on general control elements, such as input fields, list boxes and buttons. The most important control functions within LUCAS POS executed in the Transaction and Financing windows, will be explained in chapters 4 The Transaction Window, 5 Initiate Fi- nancing (The [ Total ] Button) and 6 Financing a Transaction (The Financing Window). Chapters 7 The Position Closed Window and 8 Exiting the Till will explain how to call up the Position Closed window and how to exit the till. Chapter 9 Sales Functions will explain all sales functions available. Here you will learn how to return or discount items, how to reset a transaction, or carry out a settlement. Chapter 10 Financing Functions will explain all financing functions available, e.g. financing a receipt in cash or in foreign currency, or through vouchers and coupons. Frequently occurring keywords will be explained in chapter 11 Glossary. You can also refer to chapter 12 Index as well as the Contents to quickly access required information in this user’s manual. The range of functions available depends on the individual customising of your LUCAS POS and the individual user rights. This could mean that some functions described in this user manual may not be available when you sign on to LUCAS POS. The graphical user interface in the screenshots contained in this user manual may differ from the user interface at your till. 3 The Layout of this User Manual Buttons, Notations und Cross References Buttons and Notations Terms and labelling which appear on the POS’ interface are highlighted in bold. The buttons visible on the screen are either displayed in graphic form or as follows: [ Button ] Functions which are directly dependent on the previous execution of another function may occupy the same button as is the case in Suspend Sale and Resume Sale. The [ Resume Sale ] button will only be active and visible once a Suspend Sale function has been executed. The [ Resume Sale ] button will occupy the same position as the [ Suspend Sale ] button. "

  {
    "Touchscreen": " Your till is equipped with a touchscreen to operate LUCAS POS. 1) Touch a control element (e.g. buttons, entry fields, etc.) displayed on the screen using your finger or a blunt object. The control element is activated and the function requested is executed. 3.1.1 Cleaning the Touchscreen Surface The touchscreen surface needs to be cleaned on a regular basis. 1) Press [ Cancel ] within the Sign On window. The Position Closed window opens (see 7 The Position Closed Window). 2) Press [ Clean Display ]. Position Closed window showing the [ Clean Display ] button The Clean Display window is displayed along with a set of cleaning instructions. 3) Clean the screen following the instructions displayed. If you need to clean the touchscreen while the till is still operating, call the cleaning mode.

The cleaning mode also provides you with important instructions on how to clean the touchscreen. 8 4) Press [ Finish ] within the Clean Display window to exit the cleaning mode. Clean Display window with [ Finish ] button The Clean Display window closes and the Position Closed window re-opens. 3.1.2 Inaccuracies when using the Touchscreen If the touchscreen is not correctly calibrated, inaccuracies such as the following may occur while working the till. The selected element on the user interface (e.g. a button) does not activate when touching the touchscreen, or only activates after repeated attempts. Instead of the selected element (e.g. a row in a table), the element above or below is activated. If you observe any of these inaccuracies, ask the person in charge to contact Micros for a solution. Follow the cleaning instructions displayed onscreen. Disregarding the cleaning instructions may result in damage to the screen surface! Use soft, lint-free cloths and commercial glass cleaners only. Spray glass cleaner onto the cloth, not directly onto the touchscreen. Ensure that the screen is completely dry before working with it again. 9 3.2 General Display and Control Elements The general elements described below will appear frequently within LUCAS POS operations. They provide you with transaction details and allow you to enter information or select functions or positions displayed.

    "Header": " The header displays information about the system’s name (LUCAS POS), the program’s version and the company structure (Company ID, Store ID and POS ID). In addition, the header may display a salesperson ID and a customer ID if activated for the current transaction. On the right hand side of the header two icons are displayed. If asked for the program version by a service technician or a member of the Micros hotline team simply quote it from the header. The version number displayed in the image provided in this user manual may differ from the version you are using. 10 When this icon’s signal lamp is flashing red, the till’s cash limit is reached. Execute a safe drop before continuing working the till. No safe drop is necessary while the signal lamp is green. When the signal lamp is yellow, the till is disconnected from LUCAS services at the back office. It is therefore not possible to determine whether or not a safe drop is necessary. When this icon’s signal lamp is flashing red the connection to LUCAS services at the back office is interrupted.
