Engineered for the Modern Trail Rider
The Siskiu TE Series is designed with progressive trail geometry, including a slack 65° head angle and a steep seat tube, which enhance control, stability, and comfort on challenging terrain. The 29” wheels provide high-speed stability, while the option to adjust to a mullet setup with a smaller rear wheel through the flip-chip system offers versatility and optimised performance. This adaptability ensures that the bike’s handling remains consistent, regardless of wheel configuration, providing a tailored ride for any condition.

Powerful Motor Options for Every Rider
The heart of the Siskiu TE Series lies in its powerful motor options, with each model designed to meet different performance needs. The TE-N features the BOSCH Performance Line CX motor, renowned for its smooth and reliable power delivery, making it ideal for technical and long-distance trail riding. The T7E model is equipped with the Shimano EP801 motor, known for its responsive performance and long-lasting 630Wh battery. Meanwhile, the T6E utilises the Shimano EP600 motor, offering a more accessible entry into the world of e-MTBs without compromising on power or efficiency.
